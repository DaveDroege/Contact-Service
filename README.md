SNHU CS 320 project

The way that I ensured that my program was functional and secure was through JPUnit testing, using numerous tools and tests I was able to efficiently validate that the code worked properly without error.
I can take in information from the users as feedback and use this infomration to improve the program, ensuring that these new features are tested and well developed.
Designing software starts with a plan and testing should be included in that plan. It is important to know how you are going to test your program before you even start desigining it.
